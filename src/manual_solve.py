    Problem:
        problem 447fd412 is a problem, in which a small blueprint of a shape is given
        with one or two 'anchor' points. The task is to replicate/project theses shapes onto 
        the other anchors in X, taking into consideration that their size might have changed.
        In that case the replica is upposed to be scaled to the anchors size (e.g. if the anchor is 3x3, then each 1x1 field in the template becomes of size 3x3)
        If a replica would hit a broder of the field, the rest is supposed to be cut off.

    Algorithm:
        The algorithm work as follows:
            1. identify the already drawn shape (only ones in X)
            2. identify attaching anchors (attaching 2's) they shall be the 'pins' to pin the shape on
            3. if there are 2 anchors, identify the x and y distance
                3.1 compute the relative position of all the fill points to the upper left anchor 
            4. identify all possible other clusters that are anchors (clusters of 2's)
            5. order them, from now on only the size and bottom right cornor will be considered
            6. choose a new anchor, and determine size
            7. if there were multiple pins, find other candidates (same sized anchors)
            8. remove those that are in the right position to fit from the anchor list
            9. choose the upper left most anchor
            10. fill in the shape, using the size of the anchor and its bottom right cornor
                10.1 ignore part that would be outside the field
    Solved Grids:
        All girds were solved correctly

    Relevance: 
        this problem mostly touches upon abstraction of a task and its generalization
        having seen a problem with one node solved, one should be able to solve it with X nodes as long as they are not ambigious,
        without having seen any training data towards that. The solution goes into that direction and couls with change in distance 
        measures be able to solve a N nodes problem

### Libraries used
##In order to solve the problems, mostly python internal libraries were used
##although some problem could be done more effeiciently by further numpy usage,
##most array operations are in numpy or list comrpehensions.
##The Counter from the collection module is used to efficiently create histographical representations.
